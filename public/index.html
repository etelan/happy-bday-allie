      Hello allie! 
      It will be cool if you can find a way to break it.
      However I did code it all.
      The time is calculated on server, and celebrations start when that timer hits 0.
      The countdown is purely visual.

      1) Do not try and find the github as thats cheating!
      2) There is another image uploaded to the github, its SFW. 
      The hint to find it is this:   
      Line 5:8:  'kissImage' is defined but never used  no-unused-vars
